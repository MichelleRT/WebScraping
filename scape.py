The point of this program is to web scrape data into text files for training features/weights 
in BioCompoundML. However, right now, we are keeping the web scraping and training separate, 
hence we are keeping the web scraping and training programs in different repositories.

Since no other sufficient databases for fuels containing the fuel properties RON (research 
octane number), TSI (threshold soot index), and MP (melting point) can be found, we are only 
taking data from the fuel engine co-op database 
(url: https://fuelsdb.nrel.gov/fmi/webd/FuelEngineCoOptimization).
